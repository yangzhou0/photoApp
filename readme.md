# Assignment #7 - Angular

## Intro:
This is an integration of Angular and Node. I made some improvements from [Assignment 6 project](https://github.com/HarvardDCENode/assignment-6-yangzhou93)

## How to use:


## Functionality:

1. CRUD operations are implemented:
 + Home pages Read all the photos from server
 + User can Create new photo by utilizing the Photo Upload box on the top of the home page
 + Updating photo function can be found by clicking into each individual photo
 + User can delete each photo by hitting the delete button

2. Messages component on the top of the home page provides feedback to users

3. Validation is applied to photo uploading and editing forms

4. AppRoutingModule is used to navigate between components

5. Utilize HttpClient in PhotoService to interact with data on MongoDB using REST APIs
